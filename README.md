# Plotto

Space-time plotter

Plotto draws a graphical illustration of how the properties of a slice of space change over time.

The resulting image is a vertical stack (along the time axis) of the same slices of space made at different points in time.

You can simultaneously observe several slices of space - Plotto stacks them horizontally.
